# ANT_script
This is the inofficial script for Prof Mihailescu's lectures on algebraic number theory in the winter semester 2020/21 at Georg-August-Universität Göttingen.
It requires my custom package "jvftex", which can be found and manually installed [here](https://github.com/vonfalkenstein/jvftex).
